Interpreting column names as follows:
FRQ:	Allele frequency
N:	Sample size
A1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
P:	p-Value
BETA:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
A2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.
SNP:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from /home/ha0214zh/temp/LDSC_MR_Nextflow/reference_genome/w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from /home/ha0214zh/temp/LDSC_MR_Nextflow/data/trait2.txt.gz into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.
Read 1019576 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 0 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 77 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 5 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
1019494 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (1019494 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 141635.333333 (1019494 SNPs remain).
Median value of BETA was -4.61e-05, which seems sensible.
Removed 1 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (1019493 SNPs remain).
